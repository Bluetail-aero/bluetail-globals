# bluetail-globals

Shared enums, constants, and interfaces used across all Bluetail services.

> **IMPORTANT:** Before beginning any work, read and follow the directives in [`../_solution/CLAUDE.md`](../_solution/CLAUDE.md). That file defines the required workflow for all Bluetail projects — do not skip it.

> If `../_solution` does not exist, your Bluetail projects are not in the expected flat folder structure. All repos should be sibling directories (e.g., `bluetail/app`, `bluetail/backend`, `bluetail/_solution`).
